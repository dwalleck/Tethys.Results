# Phase 3 Status - COMPLETED

## Completed Tasks

### Benchmark Project Infrastructure ✅
- Created benchmark project at `benchmark/Tethys.Results.Benchmarks`
- Added BenchmarkDotNet package references
- Configured project for .NET 8.0
- Added project reference to main library
- Added benchmark project to solution

### Baseline Benchmarks Created ✅
- **ResultCreationBenchmarks**: Measures creation overhead
  - Success/Failure creation for both Result and Result<T>
  - Different value types (int, string, collections, null)
  - Exception-based failure creation
- **CombineBenchmarks**: Tests Combine method performance
  - Various collection sizes (2, 5, 10, 50, 100)
  - All success, all failure, and mixed scenarios
  - Different input types (List, Array, Enumerable)
- **AsyncBenchmarks**: Async method performance
  - ThenAsync, MapAsync, OnSuccessAsync, OnFailureAsync
  - TryAsync with success and exception scenarios
- **FunctionalMethodsBenchmarks**: Functional programming methods
  - Match, Map, FlatMap, MapError
  - Method chaining scenarios
- **ExceptionVsResultBenchmarks**: Comparison with exception handling
  - Single operation comparison
  - Nested operation comparison
  - Variable error rates (0%, 10%, 50%, 100%)

### Performance Tests Written ✅
- Created PerformanceTests.cs to ensure optimization correctness
- Tests verify Combine single enumeration behavior
- Tests verify ConfigureAwait behavior
- Tests ensure all functionality preserved during optimization

### Combine Method Optimized ✅
- Eliminated multiple enumeration of input collections
- Changed from ToList() + Where/Select to single foreach pass
- Maintains same behavior but more efficient for large collections
- All existing tests pass

### ConfigureAwait(false) Added ✅
- Added ConfigureAwait(false) to all await calls in:
  - Result.cs (3 locations)
  - GenericResult.cs (5 locations)  
  - ResultExtensions.cs (9 locations)
- Prevents SynchronizationContext capture for better performance
- All async tests still pass

### Code Coverage Setup ✅
- Coverlet already configured in test project
- Created GitHub Actions workflow for coverage reporting
- Coverage script already exists at scripts/check-coverage.sh
- Configured for 90% threshold on new code
- Added coverage badge support for README
